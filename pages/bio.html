    <h1 class="entry-title">Bio</h1>
    
    <p>A self motivated and passionate engineer who is interested in computer graphics, simulations, machine intelligence, computer vision and everything in between.   </p>
<p>On the other side I am very much into video games(all kind), music(all kind), visual art(all kind)
and (philosophy of)sciences(almost all kind).   </p>
<p>I had a very boring start when I joined Bachelors in Mechanical, IIT Roorkee. Although it is an
awesome place, I found out that my passions don't lie in the gear box, (or the machining lab for that 
matter). Pretty soon I found myself consuming lots of games and music. Started playing with some game 
engines and created a very basic <strong>3D Flight Simulator</strong>. And that was all I did in my time there(apart 
from the other things that engineering students do).    </p>
<p>Fortunately, I got hired at <strong>VizExperts India</strong>, an information visualization company with roots in
desktop graphics. That was the time when I realized how cool programming can be!!! From there on, it has
been quite a journey. We primarily worked on our in-house 3D GIS based planning and simulation engine
built on an open source renderer, OpenSceneGraph which has been called with different names since then, 
we will just call it <strong>GeorbIS</strong>. I worked on everything from frontend UI framework to rendering and 
simulation engine to 3D computational filters. It really brought back all the lost love i had for 
classical physics in the form of Matrix transformations.Did a lot of 
app level features with direct involvement with the clients. <br/>
I also had a small role in <strong>VizSim</strong> platform, a distributed simulation engine that provides real time sensor data fusion and visualization. There I got introduced to OpenCV and computer vision in general and implemented my first object detection and tracking pipeline. It was very cool.   </p>
<p>After that, we started working on <strong>VizGame</strong>, a gamified training platform built on top of <strong>Unreal Engine</strong>. It used our GeorbIS framework as a data backend for creating procedurally populated, highly realistic terrains with GIS data. Here, again, my role went from laying out the Game design to implementing multiplayer(Co-presence) in VR. And by this time I was also involved in mentoring other people who were like me a few years back. </p>
<p>In the mean time I was getting more and more interested towards data science and machine intelligence.
So, I decided to pursue my interests with self learning, with a vision of somehow managing to merge my experience with computer graphics and simulation to the field of computer vision and robotics.</p>
<p>Lets see how far we can get.!!!! </p>
